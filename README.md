# grain-storage-monitoring-system-using-I2C-protocol-
An FPGA-based Verilog simulation that models I²C communication and automated temperature–humidity control for grain storage monitoring. The system uses threshold-based logic to trigger virtual actuators like fan, heater, cooler, and buzzer for maintaining safe storage conditions.
